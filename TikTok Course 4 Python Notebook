# **PACE stages**


Throughout these project notebooks, you'll see references to the problem-solving framework PACE. The following notebook components are labeled with the respective PACE stage: Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute.

<img src="images/Plan.png" width="100" height="100" align=left>


## **PACE: Plan**

Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document and those below to craft your response.

1. What is your research question for this data project? Later on, you will need to formulate the null and alternative hypotheses as the first step of your hypothesis test. Consider your research question now, at the start of this task.


**Response:**

There are a few possible ways to frame the research question. For example:

1) Do videos from verified accounts and videos unverified accounts have different average view counts?

2) Is there a relationship between the account being verified and the associated videos' view counts?

*Complete the following steps to perform statistical analysis of your data:*

### **Task 1. Imports and Data Loading**

Import packages and libraries needed to compute descriptive statistics and conduct a hypothesis test.

<details>
  <summary><h4><strong>Hint:</strong></h4></summary>

Be sure to import `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, and `scipy`.

</details>

# Import packages for data manipulation
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Import packages for data visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Import packages for statistical analysis/hypothesis testing
from scipy import stats

Load the dataset.

**Note:** As shown in this cell, the dataset has been automatically loaded in for you. You do not need to download the .csv file, or provide more code, in order to access the dataset and proceed with this lab. Please continue with this activity by completing the following instructions.

# Load dataset into dataframe
data = pd.read_csv("tiktok_dataset.csv")

<img src="images/Construct.png" width="100" height="100" align=left>

## **PACE: Analyze and Construct**

Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document and those below to craft your response:
1. Data professionals use descriptive statistics for Exploratory Data Analysis. How can computing descriptive statistics help you learn more about your data in this stage of your analysis?


**Response:**

In general, descriptive statistics are useful because they let you quickly explore and understand large amounts of data. In this case, computing descriptive statistics helps you quickly compute the mean values of video_view_count for each group of verified_status in the sample data.

### **Task 2. Data exploration**

Use descriptive statistics to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

You are interested in the relationship between `verified_status` and `video_view_count`. One approach is to examine the mean values of `video_view_count` for each group of `verified_status` in the sample data.

# Compute the mean `video_view_count` for each group in `verified_status`
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
data.groupby("verified_status")["video_view_count"].mean()

verified_status
not verified    265663.785339
verified         91439.164167
Name: video_view_count, dtype: float64

### **Task 3. Hypothesis testing**

Before you conduct your hypothesis test, consider the following questions where applicable to complete your code response:

1. Recall the difference between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypotheses. What are your hypotheses for this data project?

**Response:**

*   **Null hypothesis**: There is no difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to chance or sampling variability).
*    **Alternative hypothesis**: There is a difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to an actual difference in the corresponding population means).





Your goal in this step is to conduct a two-sample t-test. Recall the steps for conducting a hypothesis test:


1.   State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis
2.   Choose a significance level
3.   Find the p-value
4.   Reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis



**$H_0$**: There is no difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to chance or sampling variability).

**$H_A$**: There is a difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to an actual difference in the corresponding population means).

You choose 5% as the significance level and proceed with a two-sample t-test.

# Conduct a two-sample t-test to compare means
### YOUR CODE HERE ###

# Save each sample in a variable
not_verified = data[data["verified_status"] == "not verified"]["video_view_count"]
verified = data[data["verified_status"] == "verified"]["video_view_count"]

# Implement a t-test using the two samples
stats.ttest_ind(a=not_verified, b=verified, equal_var=False)

Ttest_indResult(statistic=25.499441780633777, pvalue=2.6088823687177823e-120)

**Response:**

Since the p-value is extremely small (much smaller than the significance level of 5%), you reject the null hypothesis. You conclude that there **is** a statistically significant difference in the mean video view count between verified and unverified accounts on TikTok.

# **PACE: Execute**

Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Execute stage.

### **Task 4. Communicate insights with stakeholders**

*Ask yourself the following question:*

*  What business insight(s) can you draw from the result of your hypothesis test?


**Response:**

The analysis shows that there is a statistically significant difference in the average view counts between videos from verified accounts and videos from unverified accounts. This suggests there might be fundamental behavioral differences between these two groups of accounts.

It would be interesting to investigate the root cause of this behavioral difference. For example, do unverified accounts tend to post more clickbait-y videos? Or are unverified accounts associated with spam bots that help inflate view counts?

The next step will be to build a regression model on verified_status. A regression model is the natural next step because the end goal is to make predictions on claim status. A regression model for verified_status can help analyze user behavior in this group of verified users. Technical note to prepare regression model: because the data is skewed, and there is a significant difference in account types, it will be key to build a logistic regression model.
